// HTTP/1.1 vs. HTTP/2: A Quick Comparison

// Connection Handling:

// HTTP/1.1: Requires multiple connections for parallelism, potentially leading to increased latency and resource usage.
// HTTP/2: Utilizes a single connection for concurrent requests, reducing latency and minimizing resource overhead.
// Multiplexing:

// HTTP/1.1: Relies on a serial processing model, where each request requires a separate connection.
// HTTP/2: Introduces multiplexing, enabling multiple requests and responses over a single connection, reducing latency and improving performance.
// Header Compression:

// HTTP/1.1: Transmits header information in plaintext, resulting in redundant data transfer and increased overhead.
// HTTP/2: Implements header compression, minimizing redundant information and optimizing data transfer efficiency.
// Binary Framing:

// HTTP/1.1: Uses a text-based format for communication, leading to parsing complexities and increased processing times.
// HTTP/2: Adopts a binary framing mechanism, simplifying parsing and making communication more efficient.
// Server Push:

// HTTP/1.1: Relies on clients to explicitly request each resource, potentially causing delays.
// HTTP/2: Introduces server push, allowing servers to proactively send resources, optimizing loading times and reducing round trips.
// Prioritization:

// HTTP/1.1: Fetches resources sequentially, potentially causing bottlenecks and slowing down page rendering.
// HTTP/2: Supports stream prioritization, enabling efficient resource handling and faster overall performance.
// Connection Encryption:

// HTTP/1.1: Does not enforce encryption by default.
// HTTP/2: Encourages the use of encryption, with major browsers supporting HTTP/2 only over encrypted connections (HTTPS).
// In summary, the transition from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2 brings about improvements in connection handling, multiplexing, header compression, binary framing, server push, prioritization, and encourages enhanced security through encryption. These advancements collectively contribute to a more efficient and responsive web experience.
